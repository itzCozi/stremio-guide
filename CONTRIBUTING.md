## Contributing

If you would like to contribute to this guide, please feel free to submit a pull request or open an
issue. You must follow the below conventions or you will die.

## Requesting a feature or reporting a bug

There are two places where to request features or report bugs:

- GitHub Issues
- The FMHY Discord server thread

### GitHub Issues

To make a GitHub issue for the guide, please visit the
[new issue page](https://github.com/itzcozi/stremio-guide/issues/new/choose) where you can pick
either the "Bug Report" or "Feature Request" template. When filling out an issue template, please
include as much detail as possible and any screenshots or console logs as appropriate. After an
issue is created, it will be assigned either the
[bug](https://github.com/itzcozi/stremio-guide/labels/bug) or
[feature](https://github.com/itzcozi/stremio-guide/labels/feature) label, along with
[awaiting approval](https://github.com/itzcozi/stremio-guide/labels/awaiting-approval). One of our
maintainers will review your issue and, if it's accepted, will set the
[approved](https://github.com/itzcozi/stremio-guide/labels/approved) label.

## Before you start!

Before starting a contribution, please check your contribution is part of an open issue on
[our issues page](https://github.com/itzcozi/stremio-guide/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aapproved).
GitHub issues are how we track our bugs and feature requests that will be implemented into the
guide - all contributions **must** have an issue and be approved by a maintainer before a pull
request can be worked on. If a pull request is opened before an issue is created and accepted, you
may risk having your pull request rejected! Always check with us before starting work on a feature -
we don't want to waste your time! Also, make sure that the issue you would like to work on has been
given the [approved](https://github.com/itzcozi/stremio-guide/labels/approved) label by a
maintainer. Otherwise, if we reject the issue, it means your work will have gone to waste!

## Contributing

If you're here because you'd like to work on an issue, amazing! Thank you for even considering
contributing to the guide; it means a lot :heart: Firstly, make sure you've read the entirety of
this document, as it contains important information about how to contribute to the guide. When you
have found a GitHub issue you would like to work on, you can request to be assigned to the issue by
commenting on the GitHub issue. If you are assigned to an issue but can't complete it for whatever
reason, no problem! Just let us know, and we will open up the issue to have someone else assigned.

### Tips

Here are some tips to make sure that your pull requests are :pinched_fingers: first time:

- KISS - Keep It Simple Soldier! - Simple code makes readable and efficient code!
- Follow standard best practices for TypeScript and Svelte / HTML & CSS.
- Keep as much as possible to the style of the guide. Look around our codebase to familiarize
  yourself with how we do things!
- Ensure to take note of the errors and warnings! **Do not ignore them!** They are there for a
  reason.
- Test, test, test! Make sure you thoroughly test the features you are contributing.
