    This guide is intended for people who read (it's a short guide, so please read it all). This is
    not a drawn-out piece of text by any means, and if you can't maintain an attention span for this
    long, <a
      href="https://www.reddit.com/"
      rel="">leave</a
    >. This is not a "how to pirate" guide; this is a "how to use Stremio" guide. If you are looking
    for a "how to pirate" guide, I suggest you look
